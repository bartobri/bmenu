bmenu \[en] general purpose terminal menu that focuses on ease of
configuration and use
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]bmenu\f[] [\f[B]\-c\f[] \f[I]MENU_FILE_PATH\f[]] [\f[B]\-t\f[]
\f[I]MENU_PROMPT\f[]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
B\-Menu is a minimalistic general purpose terminal menu written in C.
It was designed to replace terminal\-based login managers such as CDM.
However, it can easily serve as a simple terminal menu for any situation
where you would like to execute a command from a set of menu selections.
.PP
B\-Menu has zero dependencies and it is intentionally feature\-minimal.
This keeps it easy to install, configure, and run.
.PP
Note that bmenu uses ANSI/VT100 terminal escape sequences to draw the
menu in the terminal window.
Most modern terminal programs support these sequences so this should not
be an issue for most users.
If yours does not, the menu may not render properly in your terminal
window.

.SH DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL
.PP
To install this project from source, you will need to have the tools
\f[C]git\f[], \f[C]gcc\f[], and \f[C]make\f[] to download and build it.

installed.
.PP
Once you have the necessary tools installed, follow these instructions:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
git\ clone\ https://github.com/bartobri/bmenu.git
cd\ ./bmenu
make
sudo\ make\ install
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This will build and install \f[C]bmenu\f[] in to the /usr/local/bin
directory.
.SS UNINSTALL
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
sudo\ make\ uninstall
\f[]
.fi
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
By default, b\-menu looks for menu options in $HOME/.bmenu.
This file should consist of one menu option and one command on each
line, seperated by a colon.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Clear\ Screen:/usr/bin/clear
Dir\ Listing:/usr/bin/ls\ \-l
\f[]
.fi
.SH RUN AS A LOGIN MANAGER
.PP
To run b\-menu when you login, place the following code in
\f[C]$HOME/.bash_profile\f[]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
if\ [[\ "$(tty)"\ ==\ \[aq]/dev/tty1\[aq]\ ]];\ then
\ \ \ \ [[\ \-n\ "$BMENU_SPAWN"\ ]]\ &&\ return
\ \ \ \ export\ BMENU_SPAWN=1
\ \ \ \ #\ Avoid\ executing\ bmenu\ when\ X11\ has\ already\ been\ started.
\ \ \ \ [[\ \-z\ "$DISPLAY$SSH_TTY$(pgrep\ xinit)"\ ]]\ &&\ exec\ bmenu
fi
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you do this, it is best to include a menu option to launch a shell.
Add the following to your menu options file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Shell:/bin/bash\ \-\-login
\f[]
.fi
